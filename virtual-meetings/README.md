## Organization

* Talks are [TLP:WHITE](https://www.first.org/tlp/) unless otherwise specified
* Talks are in English
* Talks are done via **Zoom**
* - Free account (limited to 40', 100 participants)
* - Do we record sessions? The 'physical' meetings says no recordings
* - - Can't prevent participants in screen recording. Free Zoom version does not support recording (??)
* Announcements of meeting via [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/BelgoMISP/)
* Feedback via [Meetup Feedback features](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013054151-Viewing-event-feedback-from-members)
* Agenda on **Github** (one page per meeting). New items via PR
* Currently mostly done by @treyka and @cudeso ; require additional support

## Frequency
* Once a month? 
* Bi-weekly?

## Possible topics
* Demo of new MISP features
* - Dial in by someone from CIRCL / MISP Project?

* Q/A session
